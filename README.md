<p>
  I have used HTML, minimal CSS and basic Js to create this simple project.
  In js I have learnt usage of :
  "queryselector()", "addEventListner()", concept of callback in this project.
  Moreover, I have checked for cases, where user if by mistake enters any character in place of numeric value , then it will show 'invalid entry' message:

While in all other cases it will give you your correct BMI :

<h4> Bonus :</h4>
<p>
  At footer it has BMI guide as to check in which category our BMI falls. Categories are Under_Weight, Normal and Over_Weight.

  Scope of improvement:
  In future, this calculator will automatically declare the above mentioned category according to calculated BMI.
  Also styling needs a little work.
